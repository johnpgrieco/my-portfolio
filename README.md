# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio of Project Management artifacts and code samples. Feel free to use
any of these in your project(s) as needed. 

The files in the root are my Project Management (PM) artifacts (screenshots of the apps I
worked on as a PM, sample reports and project plans). The exception is Recommendations.png, 
which is a listing of career recommendations (references).  

The 'code samples' folder contains the code I created. 

I welcome your feedback! If you have any questions, see an issue or a feature you'd 
like me to add, I can be reached at jpgrieco@outlook.com.
